# Version Control with Git

This is a repository to practice version control with git. I am following the course [Version control with git](https://www.coursera.org/learn/version-control-with-git/) from Coursera and stuff obtained form random Googling. Hope this repo will be a useful material for any git n00b.

3. **Local repository**: Contains the commits of the project
4. **Project directory**: 1,2 and 3 together in the local computer. (basically the location of the project in our computer)
